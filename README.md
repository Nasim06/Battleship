The game of Battleship, written in C.

This game is played in the console/terminal.

This game uses ANSI escape characters so the board may not be printed correctly if you're running it on windows cmd or powershell,
an easy way around this is to just use wsl (windows subsystem for linux).

If you actually want to play it, the compiled executable is included. You could also compile with gcc if you want.
